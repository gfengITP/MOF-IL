# MOF-IL Database
# Overview
The MOF-IL database is composed of 510 entries of supercapcitors based on different metal-organic framework (MOF) electrodes and ionic liquid electrolyte. Each entrie contains pore structure descriptors of the MOF electrode and corresponding electrochemical performance derived from constant-potential molecular dynamics. The MOF structures are taken from the [QMOF database](https://github.com/Andrew-S-Rosen/QMOF).
